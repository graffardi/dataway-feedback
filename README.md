# dataway-feedback

This project has been created in addition to a **"Dataway in a React/Redux application"**.

It provides:
  * [`master`](https://github.com/graffardi/dataway-feedback/tree/master) branch: An application **without** `dataway`, to illustrate some corner cases / errors we might be facing.
  * [`dataway`](https://github.com/graffardi/dataway-feedback/tree/dataway) branch: An application **with** `dataway`, to illustrate how the library can secure the use of asynchronous datas and make React/Redux happier. ðŸ™ƒ

You can find the:
  * [dataway repository here](https://github.com/iadvize/dataway)
  * [dataway documentation here](https://iadvize.github.io/dataway/)

The application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
